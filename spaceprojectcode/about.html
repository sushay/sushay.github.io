        <h1>Juventas: Roman Godess of Youth</h1>
        <p> <b>For a child, the world is their classroom. Juventas asks, why can’t the universe be?</b> With man’s future in the stars, expanding our presence there is an expensive enterprise. Our current model of space explorations requires us to challenge the barriers of physics, times, and money. Juventas is taking a revolutionary new approach to man's future in space travel.</p> 
            
        <p>Physical Barriers - Our largest enemy in this process is Gravity. Getting out of earth's lower atmosphere requires an immense amount of energy and lift to get off the ground needed to combat the gravity of our planet. <i> Our belief at Juventas is that great things come in small packages - and space travel agrees.</i> With the use of our youthful astronauts, we can drastically reduce the load-bearing stresses of our rockets.</p>     
        
        <p>Educational Barriers - A child will spend an average of 13 years in primary education in United States. Juventas challenges that norm by devolping an education program designed for children who demostrate exceptional academic, athletic, and creative skills. Recruting children between the ages of 6 and 10, our students are provided with a complete, well rounded education with specilazed courses in the STEM field. At the age of 10, our students transition into a full time, residential program at our faciliatly in California on the Space X campus, for both advanced training and developement. </p>
        
        <p>Juventas will focus on missions demanding long term, deep space missions. Our stepping stone will be Mars, with hopeful inclusion of a secondary training and refuel station. For more infomration about current and future missions, please visit our "Missions" page.    </p>
