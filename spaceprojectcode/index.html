                    <p>Since Joey first learned to talk, he has talked about the stars. With his eyes on the skies, he began to investiage our space exploration history with the help of his parents and teachers. Accepted to California's top STEM focused early education program at age 4, he stood out amoung his fellow students early on. Joey's acceptance to Juventas fed his veracious appitate for education and space exploration, now within a peergroup that matches him.
